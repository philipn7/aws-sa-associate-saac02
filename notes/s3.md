# Simple Storage Service (S3)
## Security
- Private by default
- Bucket policies are resource policies. Mainly used for giving permissions for the same or *different* accounts or **anonymous principals (unauthenticated)**.
- When to use Identity or Resource policies?

## S3 Static Website Hosting
- Access s3 object using HTTP (vs aws api).
- For a small blog, the free tier can handle it. 17 cents was a max charge. The bucket name must match the domain name though.

## Object Versioning & MFA Delete
- **Once you enable Object versioning, you CANNOT disable it again. Only option is to suspend it.**

- **What is MFADelete?**  Enabled in versioning configuration. MFA is required to: change bucket state and delete versions of objects.

## Performance Optimization
- S3 Uploads (PutObject):
- Single PUT Upload. If stream fails, upload fails. Max size: 5gb
- Multipart Upload. Data is broken, minimum size 100mb. Max size: 10,000 parts, 5mb - 5gb each.
- S3 Transfer Acceleration - Use AWS edge locations to transfer instead of public internet
