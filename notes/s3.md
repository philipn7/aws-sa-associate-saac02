# Simple Storage Service (S3)
## Security
- Private by default
- Bucket policies are resource policies. Mainly used for giving permissions for the same or *different* accounts or **anonymous principals (unauthenticated)**.
- When to use Identity or Resource policies?

## S3 Static Website Hosting
- Access s3 object using HTTP (vs aws api).
- For a small blog, the free tier can handle it. 17 cents was a max charge. The bucket name must match the domain name though.

## Object Versioning & MFA Delete
- **Once you enable Object versioning, you CANNOT disable it again. Only option is to suspend it.**

- **What is MFADelete?**  Enabled in versioning configuration. MFA is required to: change bucket state and delete versions of objects.

## Performance Optimization
- S3 Uploads (PutObject):
- Single PUT Upload. If stream fails, upload fails. Max size: 5gb
- Multipart Upload. Data is broken, minimum size 100mb. Max size: 10,000 parts, 5mb - 5gb each.
- S3 Transfer Acceleration - Use AWS edge locations to transfer instead of public internet

## Key Management Service
- These keys never leave KMS. **Need to know KMS complies with FIPS 140-2 (L2)**
- ![](images/Pasted%20image%2020211030143316.png)
- The CMK has a 4k limit. DEK are keys used for larger files. DEK is encrypted by CMK. You're given the encrypted DEK and plaintext DEK. Discard the plaintext after use.

- Encryption key rotation = KMS

- Key policies on CMK.

## S3 Encryption
- Encryption is OBJECT level.

- ![](images/Pasted%20image%2020211030150306.png)
- **SSE-S3 uses AES256**
- Remember that if asked for key rotation or roles == KMS managed S3 encryption

## S3 Storage Classes
- Use 'S3 Standard' for *frequently accessed* data which is important and non-replaceable.
- 'S3 Standard-IA' Infrequent Access. Used for long-term data, which is important but where access is infrequent. Half price of 'Standard' but incur costs for retrieval and has minimum storage duration charge.
- 'S3 One Zone-IA' Same as above is that data is only stored on one zone. Used for long-lived data, NON-CRITICAL & replaceable and infrequent.
- 'S3 Glacier' 1/5th cost of 'Standard'. "cold objects"= not immediately available. Cannot be made publicly available. First byte latency of **minutes or hours**. Useful for archival data.
- 'S3 Glacier Deep Archive' 1/4th cost of 'Glacier'. "Frozen" charged 180 days minimum duration. 12-48 hours retrieval time!!
- 'S3 Intelligent-Tiering' has 4 different tiers. Auto migration. Used for long-lived data, with changing / unknown patterns.

## S3 Lifecycle
- ![](images/Pasted%20image%2020211030153923.png)
- Rules for transitioning storage classes or deleting.
*EXAM:* 
- Smaller objects can cost MORE due to minimum size
- Object needs to be on 'S3 Standard' for min 30 days before transitioning.
- Obsure rule: a *single rule* cannot transition from 'Standard' to 'IA, Intelligent, one zone' then to 'glacier' within 30 days.
- On exam, if asked about managing costs inside a version controlled bucket, can use Lifecycle expiration actions. (delete after some set days.)
- go over quickly, not covered too much on exam

## S3 Replication
- Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is the process used when Source and Destination are in different AWS regions
- Same-Region Replication (SRR) is used when the buckets are in the same region.
