# Cloud Computing
## Five characteristic of cloud computing
* On-Demand Self-Service - can provision capabilities as needed *without requiring human interaction*
* Broad Network Access - Access services over any networks, on any devices, using standard protocols and methods.
* Resource Pooling - Economies of scale, cheaper service
* Rapid Elasticity - Capabilities can be scaled(elastically provisioned) in response to system load
* Measured Service - Resource usage can be measured. Pay for what you consume

## Public, Private, Multi, Hybrid Cloud
* Public cloud - using 1 public cloud
* Private cloud - using on-premise *real* cloud. AWS Outpost, Azure Stack, Anthos.
* Multi-cloud - using more than 1 *public* cloud
* Hybrid cloud - Public and Private clouds
* Hybrid cloud is **not** public cloud + legacy on-premises

## Cloud Service Models
* On-Premises
* Data Center Hosted
* IAAS
* PAAS
* SAAS
